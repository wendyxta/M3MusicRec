# 🎧 Model Card: Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name  

Give your model a short, descriptive name.  
Example: **VibeFinder 1.0**  

---

## 2. Intended Use  

Describe what your recommender is designed to do and who it is for. 

Prompts:  

- What kind of recommendations does it generate  
- What assumptions does it make about the user  
- Is this for real users or classroom exploration  

---

## 3. How the Model Works  

Explain your scoring approach in simple language.  

Prompts:  

- What features of each song are used (genre, energy, mood, etc.)  
- What user preferences are considered  
- How does the model turn those into a score  
- What changes did you make from the starter logic  

Avoid code here. Pretend you are explaining the idea to a friend who does not program.

## 4. Data  

Describe the dataset the model uses.  

Prompts:  

- How many songs are in the catalog  
- What genres or moods are represented  
- Did you add or remove data  
- Are there parts of musical taste missing in the dataset  

---

## 5. Strengths  

Where does your system seem to work well  

Prompts:  

- User types for which it gives reasonable results  
- Any patterns you think your scoring captures correctly  
- Cases where the recommendations matched your intuition  

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias 

Where the system struggles or behaves unfairly. 

Prompts:  

- Features it does not consider  
- Genres or moods that are underrepresented  
- Cases where the system overfits to one preference  
- Ways the scoring might unintentionally favor some users  

The main limitations and biases are the limited song data and uneven weights. The genre weight is a bit heavier relative to the other signals that it creates a filter bubble. For example, once a user's favorite genre matches any song, that song will almost always rank above a cross-genre song, even if the cross-genre song fits the user's mood and energy far better. This means users whose preferred genre is well-represented in the catalog (like pop or lofi, each with 4 songs) receive a wider, more competitive recommendation pool, while users preferring a rarer genre like ambient (2 songs ) get recommendations dominated by the same two songs every time.

## 7. Evaluation  

How you checked whether the recommender behaved as expected. 

Prompts:  

- Which user profiles you tested  
- What you looked for in the recommendations  
- What surprised you  
- Any simple tests or comparisons you ran  

No need for numeric metrics unless you created some.

I have checked whether the recommender behaved as expected by testing out all 3 user profiles, checking out the recommendations for each distinct profile, and make sure the recommendations are reasonable and that they are not the same across the different profiles. I also made sure that the songs that matched the genre listed in the user profile to appear at the top.

## 8. Future Work  

Ideas for how you would improve the model next.  

Prompts:  

- Additional features or preferences  
- Better ways to explain recommendations  
- Improving diversity among the top results  
- Handling more complex user tastes  

---

## 9. Personal Reflection  

A few sentences about your experience.  

Prompts:  

- What you learned about recommender systems  
- Something unexpected or interesting you discovered  
- How this changed the way you think about music recommendation apps
